# calculator

This is the final project of the Odin Project's Foundation course. I will be making a functioning calculator that will take two numbers and an operator, and will output the result of this sum. I will be implementing a GUI as well.

# post-project
This project was really challenging, I had to seriously stretch my brain for this one. My calculator has a few minor nitpicks that could do w/ ironing out, but on the whole it works and doesn't seem to break as far as I can tell. The only thing I didn't implement from the project spec is the keyboard functionality. Besides that, I'm overall quite happy and proud of how this has turned out.

I'm realising now there is an option to disable buttons in JS, and I can picture how I would do things differently next time. On the whole, I think I've learnt from this. Next time I will definitely spend more time planning before I get into actually programming anything.

# calculator

This is the final project of the Odin Project's Foundation course. I will be making a functioning calculator that will take two numbers and an operator, and will output the result of this sum. I will be implementing a GUI as well.

# To-Do

1. Create functions for all basic operators:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
    - These will be tested in the console first, before any GUI, to ensure the underlying functionality works.
    - Each operation will consist of three variables:
        - Number A
        - Operator
        - Number B
    - Create a function operate() that takes the variables and calls the appropriate function above, to output a sum.

2. Create the HTML calculator
    - At this point, it is about creating a GUI that looks good, implementing the code will come after
    - Should include all digits and operators (and an =)
    - Should include a display
    - Add a clear button

3. Make the calcuator work!
    - I will write more once I get to this stage, as I'm unsure how I will exactly implement this yet.
